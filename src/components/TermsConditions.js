        <h1>Disclaimers — Service is “As Is”</h1><br/>
        <p style={{fontSize:"18px",lineHeight:"35px"}}>JellyKi aims to give you great Services but there are some things we can’t guarantee. Your use of our Services is at your sole risk.<br/>
        You understand that our Services and any content posted or shared by users on the Services are provided “as is” and “as available” <br/>
        without warranties of any kind, either express or implied, including implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, <br/>
        title, and non-infringement. In addition, JellyKi doesn’t represent or warrant that our Services are accurate, complete, reliable, current or <br/>
        error-free. No advice or information obtained from JellyKi or through the Services will create any warranty or representation not expressly <br/>
        made in this paragraph. JellyKi may provide information about third-party products, services, activities or events, or we may allow third <br/>
        parties to make their content and information available on or through our Services (collectively, “Third-Party Content”). We do not control or <br/>
        endorse, and we make no representations or warranties regarding, any Third-Party Content. You access and use Third-Party Content at your <br/>
        own risk. Some locations don’t allow the disclaimers in this paragraph and so they might not apply to you.</p><br/>
        <h1>Limitation of Liability</h1><br/>
        <p style={{fontSize:"18px",lineHeight:"35px"}}>We don’t exclude or limit our liability to you where it would be illegal to do so; this includes any liability for the gross negligence, fraud or <br/>
        intentional misconduct of JellyKi or the other JellyKi Parties in providing the Services. In countries where the following types of exclusions <br/>
        aren’t allowed, we’re responsible to you only for losses and damages that are a reasonably foreseeable result of our failure to use reasonable <br/>
        care and skill or our breach of our contract with you. This paragraph doesn’t affect consumer rights that can’t be waived or limited by any <br/>
        contract or agreement.<br/>
        In countries where exclusions or limitations of liability are allowed, JellyKi and JellyKi Parties won’t be liable for:<br/>
        (a) Any indirect, consequential, exemplary, incidental, punitive, or special damages, or any loss of use, data or profits, under any legal theory, <br/>
        even if JellyKi or the other JellyKi Parties have been advised of the possibility of such damages.<br/>
        (b) Other than for the types of liability we can’t limit by law (as described in this section), we limit the total liability of JellyKi and the other <br/>
        JellyKi Parties for any claim arising out of or relating to these Terms or our Services, regardless of the form of the action, to the greater of <br/>
        1000.00 INR or the amount paid by you to use our Services.</p><br/>
        <h1>Resolving Disputes; Binding Arbitration</h1><br/>
        <p style={{fontSize:"18px",lineHeight:"35px"}}>We want to address your concerns without needing a formal legal case. Before filing a claim against JellyKi, you agree to contact us and <br/>
        attempt to resolve the claim informally by sending a written notice of your claim by email at legal@nebutech.in. The notice must <br/>
        (a) include your name, residence address, email address, and telephone number; <br/>
        (b) describe the nature and basis of the claim; and <br/>
        (c) set forth the specific relief sought. Our notice to you will be sent to the email address associated with your online account and will <br/>
        contain the information described above. If we can’t resolve matters within thirty (30) days after any notice is sent, either party may <br/>
        initiate a formal proceeding.<br/>
        Please read the following section carefully because it requires you to arbitrate certain disputes and claims with JellyKi and limits the manner <br/>
        in which you can seek relief from us, unless you opt out of arbitration by following the instructions set forth below. No class or representative <br/>
        actions or arbitrations are allowed under this arbitration provision. In addition, arbitration precludes you from suing in court.<br/>
        (a) No Representative Actions. You and JellyKi agree that any dispute arising out of or related to these Terms or our Services is personal to <br/>
        you and JellyKi and that any dispute will be resolved solely through individual action, and will not be brought as a class arbitration, class <br/>
        action or any other type of representative proceeding.<br/>
        (b) Arbitration of Disputes. Except for small claims disputes in which you or JellyKi seeks to bring an individual action in small claims court <br/>
        located in the county where you reside or disputes in which you or JellyKi seeks injunctive or other equitable relief for the alleged infringement <br/>
        or misappropriation of intellectual property, you and JellyKi waive your rights to a jury trial and to have any other dispute arising out of or <br/>
        related to these Terms or our Services, including claims related to privacy and data security, (collectively, “Disputes”) resolved in court. <br/>
        All Disputes submitted to be resolved through confidential, binding arbitration before one arbitrator. Arbitration proceedings will be held <br/>
        in Bangalore, Karnataka unless you’re a consumer, in which case you may elect to hold the arbitration in your county of residence. <br/>
        For purposes of this section a “consumer” means a person using the Services for personal, family or household purposes. <br/>
        You and JellyKi agree that Disputes will be held in accordance with the Arbitration Rules and Procedures.<br/>
        (c) The arbitration will allow for the discovery or exchange of non-privileged information relevant to the Dispute. The arbitrator, JellyKi,<br/>
        and you will maintain the confidentiality of any arbitration proceedings, judgments and awards, including information gathered, prepared <br/>
        and presented for purposes of the arbitration or related to the Dispute(s) therein. The arbitrator will have the authority to make appropriate <br/>
        rulings to safeguard confidentiality, unless the law provides to the contrary. The duty of confidentiality doesn’t apply to the extent that <br/>
        disclosure is necessary to prepare for or conduct the arbitration hearing on the merits, in connection with a court application for a <br/>
        preliminary remedy, or in connection with a judicial challenge to an arbitration award or its enforcement, or to the extent that disclosure is <br/>
        otherwise required by law or judicial decision.<br/>
        (d) You and JellyKi agree that for any arbitration you initiate, you will pay the filing fee (up to a maximum of 50000 INR if you are a consumer), <br/>
        and JellyKi will pay the remaining fees and costs. For any arbitration initiated by JellyKi, JellyKi will pay all fees and costs. You and JellyKi <br/>
        agree that the state or federal courts of the State of Karnataka have exclusive jurisdiction over any appeals and the enforcement of an <br/>
        arbitration award.<br/>
        (e) Any Dispute must be filed within one year after the relevant claim arose; otherwise, the Dispute is permanently barred, which means that <br/>
        you and JellyKi will not have the right to assert the claim.<br/>
        (f) You have the right to opt out of binding arbitration within 30 days of the date you first accepted the terms of this section by sending an <br/>
        email of your request to legal@nebutech.in. In order to be effective, the opt-out notice must include your full name and address and clearly <br/>
        indicate your intent to opt out of binding arbitration. By opting out of binding arbitration, you are agreeing to resolve Disputes in accordance <br/>
        with the next section regarding “Governing Law and Venue.”<br/>
        (g) If any portion of this section is found to be unenforceable or unlawful for any reason, <br/>
        (1) the unenforceable or unlawful provision shall be severed from these Terms; <br/>
        (2) severance of the unenforceable or unlawful provision shall have no impact whatsoever on the remainder of this section or the parties’ <br/>
        ability to compel arbitration of any remaining claims on an individual basis pursuant to this section; and (3) to the extent that any claims <br/>
        must therefore proceed on a class, collective, consolidated, or representative basis, such claims must be litigated in a civil court of <br/>
        competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration, and the parties agree that litigation of those claims shall be stayed pending the outcome <br/>
        of any individual claims in arbitration. Further, if any part of this section is found to prohibit an individual claim seeking public injunctive <br/>
        relief, that provision will have no effect to the extent such relief is allowed to be sought out of arbitration, and the remainder of this section <br/>
        will be enforceable.</p><br/>
        <h1>Governing Law and Venue</h1><br/><br/>
        <p style={{fontSize:"18px",lineHeight:"25px"}}>These Terms and any dispute that arises between you and JellyKi will be governed by Republic of Indian law.<br/>
        Some countries have laws that require agreements to be governed by the local laws of the consumer’s country. This paragraph doesn’t <br/>
        override those laws.</p><br/>
        <h1>Amendments</h1><br/>
        <p style={{fontSize:"18px",lineHeight:"25px"}}>We may make changes to these Terms from time to time. If we make changes, we’ll provide you with notice of them by sending an email <br/>
        to the email address associated with your account, offering an in-product notification, or updating the date at the top of these Terms. <br/>
        Unless we say otherwise in our notice, the amended Terms will be effective immediately, and your continued use of our Services after we <br/>
        provide such notice will confirm your acceptance of the changes. If you don’t agree to the amended Terms, you must stop using our Services.<br/>
        </p><br/>
        <h1>Severability</h1><br/>
        <p style={{fontSize:"18px",lineHeight:"25px"}}>If any provision or part of a provision of these Terms is unlawful, void or unenforceable, that provision or part of the provision is deemed <br/>
        severable from these Terms and does not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.<br/>
        </p><br/>
        <h1>Miscellaneous</h1><br/>
        <p style={{fontSize:"18px",lineHeight:"25px"}}>JellyKi’s failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not operate as a waiver of such right or provision. <br/>
        These Terms, and the terms and policies listed in the Other Terms and Policies that May Apply to You Section, reflect the entire agreement <br/>
        between the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements, statements and understandings of the parties. <br/>
        The section titles in these Terms are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. Use of the word “including” will be <br/>
        interpreted to mean “including without limitation.” Except as otherwise provided herein, these Terms are intended solely for the benefit <br/>
        of the parties and are not intended to confer third-party beneficiary rights upon any other person or entity. You agree that communications <br/>
        and transactions between us may be conducted electronically.<br/>
